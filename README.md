# Python for Natural Language Processing (On-progress...)

This is the repository for the Natural Language Processing at Asian Institute of Technology

Google slide lectures can be found in:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14x9_-Y_aWysPIZFLaVrZE2ngy2h_beJj?usp=sharing and  

I would also like to give huge credits to several githubs/web resources that I have revised to create this:

SpaCy
- http://spacy.pythonhumanities.com/
- http://courses.spacy.com

Torchtext
- https://github.com/bentrevett (created an awesome github for learning NLP!)

Other useful stuffs
- https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/ (a lot of our assignments and lectures come from Manning's awesome course!)
- https://github.com/graykode/nlp-tutorial (a simple github with very short code; good for learning)
- https://github.com/mhagiwara/100-nlp-papers (listed first 100 influential NLP papers)
- https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp (collection of all NLP learning resources)
- https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress (omg...this is like a mini wikipedia for NLP!)

I would also like to thank students who have contributed:

- Amanda Raj Shrestha;  Email: st122245@ait.ac.th
- Pranisaa Charnparttarvanit; Email: st121720@ait.ac.th
- Chanapa Pananookooln; Email: st121395@ait.ac.th
