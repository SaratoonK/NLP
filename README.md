# Python for Natural Language Processing (On-progress...)

This is the repository for the Natural Language Processing at Asian Institute of Technology.

### Credits

I would also like to give huge credits to several githubs/web resources that I have revised to create this:

- https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/ (our dependency parser tutorial is dissected from their assignment 3)
- http://spacy.pythonhumanities.com/ (our spaCy tutorials are edited from here)
- http://courses.spacy.com (and here as well)
- https://github.com/bentrevett (our DL part is edited from here)
- https://huggingface.co/course (there is no better tutorial than what huggingface made themselves)
- https://guide.allennlp.org (same here..)
- https://captum.ai/tutorials/

Other useful stuffs
- https://github.com/graykode/nlp-tutorial (our word2vec comes from here....)
- https://github.com/mhagiwara/100-nlp-papers (listed first 100 influential NLP papers)
- https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp (collection of all NLP learning resources)
- https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress (omg...this is like a mini wikipedia for NLP!)

I would also like to thank students who have contributed:

- Amanda Raj Shrestha;  Email: st122245@ait.ac.th
- Pranisaa Charnparttarvanit; Email: st121720@ait.ac.th
- Chanapa Pananookooln; Email: st121395@ait.ac.th
