# NLP - Natural Language Processing

This is the repository for the Natural Language Processing at Asian Institute of Technology.

I would also like to give huge credits to several githubs/web resources that I have revised to create this:

- https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/
- https://github.com/bentrevett
- https://github.com/graykode/nlp-tutorial
- https://github.com/mhagiwara/100-nlp-papers
- https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp
- https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress

I would also like to thank students who have contributed:

- Pranisaa Charnparttarvanit; Office Hours:  ; Email: 
- Chanapa Pananookooln; Office Hours:  ; Email: 

If you have any questions regarding the lectures/assignments, do not hesitate to contact them in their office hours.
