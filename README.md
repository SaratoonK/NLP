# NLP / NLU - Natural Language Processing / Natural Language Understanding

This is the repository for the Natural Language Processing / Natural Language Understanding at Asian Institute of Technology.

I would also like to give huge credits to several githubs/web resources that I have revised to create this:

- https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/
- https://github.com/bentrevett
- https://github.com/graykode/nlp-tutorial
- https://github.com/mhagiwara/100-nlp-papers
- https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp
- https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress

I would also like to thank students who have contributed:

- Pranisaa Charnparttarvanit; Office Hours:  ; Email: 
- Chanapa Pananookooln; Office Hours:  ; Email: 

If you have any questions regarding the lectures/assignments, do not hesitate to contact them in their office hours.

## Grade Criteria

The course has the following grade criteria:
1. Assignment (58%) --> 
    - There will be a total of 5 coding assignments + 1 paper presentation assignment
    - Any late work (indicated by Google Classroom) will be deducted 50%.  **NO excuses** will be accepted.
    - We are extremely serious about copying and plagiarism.  This assignment is intended for you to learn.  TA has the privilege to give zeros or partial score to any sort of plagiarism or alike.  Their call is final.
      -  A1: Getting Started (4%)
      -  A2: Word2Vec (10%)
