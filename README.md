# NLP / NLU - Natural Language Processing / Natural Language Understanding

This is the repository for the Natural Language Processing / Natural Language Understanding at Asian Institute of Technology.

I would also like to give credits to several githubs/web resources that I have revised to create this:

- https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/
- https://github.com/bentrevett
- https://github.com/graykode/nlp-tutorial
- https://github.com/mhagiwara/100-nlp-papers
- https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp
- https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress

I would also like to thank students who have contributed:

- Pranisaa Charnparttarvanit
- Chanapa Pananookooln

## Prerequisites

This course is best taken after the following courses offered in the August semester:

- Python for DSAI by myself - https://github.com/chaklam-silpasuwanchai/Python-for-DS-AI
- Machine Learning by Matthew Dailey - https://github.com/dsai-asia/ML

## Course Outline

The course is structured into 3 big components (and 1 small component):

### 1. Natural Language Understanding
Focus on understanding basic knowledge
  - The whole process of understanding - tokenization, lemming, stemming, POS, etc.
  - Dependency Parsing
  - Constituent Parsing
  - NLP Tasks

### 2. Word Embeddings
Focus on understanding how word representations work
  - Word2Vec
  - GloVe
  - FastText
  - ELMo
  - Other rising stars
  
### 3. Neural Network
Focus on understanding common neural network architecture for NLP
  - Recurrent Neural Network
  - Long Short-Term Memory
  - Long Short-Term Memory with Attention
  - Long Short-Term Memory with Multiheaded Attention
  - Seq2seq (Encoder-Decoder)
  - Seq2seq (Transformers)

### 4. Contemporary Topics
Ask students to share their knowledge after reading assigned papers

## Grade Criteria

The course has the following grade criteria:
1. Assignment (50%) --> 
    - There will be a total of 5 coding assignments + 1 paper presentation assignment
    - Any late work (indicated by Google Classroom) will be deducted 50%.  **NO excuses** will be accepted.
    - We are extremely serious about copying and plagiarism.  This assignment is intended for you to learn.  TA has the privilege to give zeros or partial score to any sort of plagiarism or alike.  Their call is final.
      -  A0: ???? (2%)
      -  A1: Getting Started (4%)
      -  A2: Word2Vec (10%)
      -  A3: Dependency Parsing (10%)
      -  A4: Bidirectional LSTM with Attention for Classification from Scratch (10%)
      -  A5: Encoder-Decoder with Attention for Seq2Seq from Scratch (10%)
      -  A6: Paper Reading (4%)  
2. Final Project (50%) - 1 week project progress
    - Four project topics will be given as follows:
      - (1) 
    - Main criteria focuses on learning, in particular
      - (1)  
    - Submission deliverables:  
      - (1) python file (e.g., notebook, .py)
      - (2) presentation file (e.g., .pdf, .ppt)
