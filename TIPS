## Finding existing research

Often helpful to check existing research how they do the research, e.g., what task they used, what datasets are common in the area, which evaluation metrics to use.  Reading papers will save you A LOT of time
- Browse recent publications at any of the top venues where NLP / Deep learning is published: ACL, EMNLP, TACL, NAACL, EACL, NIPS, ICLR, ICML, NIPS, etc.
- Publications at many NLP venues are indexed at http://www.aclweb.org/anthology

## Find datasets

We generally DO NOT recommend collecting your own datasets because it is very time consuming and prone to messy process.  Also, it does not allow comparison with past works.  Try use existing datasets, and instead focus on improving and understanding the models
