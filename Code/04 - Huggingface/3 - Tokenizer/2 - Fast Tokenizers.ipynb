    "In this section we will take a closer look at the capabilities of the tokenizers in ü§ó Transformers. Up to now we have only used them to tokenize inputs or decode IDs back into text, but tokenizers ‚Äî especially those backed by the ü§ó Tokenizers library ‚Äî can do a lot more. To illustrate these additional features, we will explore how to reproduce the results of the token-classification (that we called ner) and question-answering pipelines that we first encountered in Chapter 1."

In the next chapter, we‚Äôll see how we can use this capability to apply the labels we have for each word properly to the tokens in tasks like named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging.
