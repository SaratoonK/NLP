    "# Training a new tokenizer from an old one\n",
    "\n",
    "If a language model is not available in the language you are interested in, or if your corpus is very different from the one your language model was trained on, you will most likely want to retrain the model from scratch using a tokenizer adapted to your data. That will require training a new tokenizer on your dataset. But what exactly does that mean? When we first looked at tokenizers in Chapter 2, we saw that most Transformer models use a subword tokenization algorithm. To identify which subwords are of interest and occur most frequently in the corpus at hand, the tokenizer needs to take a hard look at all the texts in the corpus — a process we call training. The exact rules that govern this training depend on the type of tokenizer used, and we’ll go over the three main algorithms later in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assembling a corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a very simple API in 🤗 Transformers that you can use to train a new tokenizer with the same characteristics as an existing one: AutoTokenizer.train_new_from_iterator(). To see this in action, let’s say we want to train GPT-2 from scratch, but in a language other than English. Our first task will be to gather lots of data in that language in a training corpus. To provide examples everyone will be able to understand, we won’t use a language like Russian or Chinese here, but rather a specialized English language: Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 🤗 Datasets library can help us assemble a corpus of Python source code. We’ll use the usual load_dataset() function to download and cache the CodeSearchNet dataset.

Python is the language most often used for data science and deep learning applications, but when anything needs to be parallelized to be fast, it has to be written in another language. For instance, the matrix multiplications that are at the core of the model computation are written in CUDA, an optimized C library for GPUs.\n",
