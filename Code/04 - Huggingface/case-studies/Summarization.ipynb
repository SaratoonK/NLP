Some have remarked that they wanted dividers for the drawers, and that they made those. Good idea. My application was that I needed something that I can see the contents at about eye level, so I wanted the fuller-sized drawers. I also like that these are the new plastic that doesn\\'t get brittle and split like my older plastic drawers did. I like the all-plastic construction. It\\'s heavy duty enough to hold metal parts, but being made of plastic it\\'s not as heavy as a metal frame, so you can easily mount it to the wall and still load it up with heavy stuff, or light stuff.

Accordingly, most Transformer models for summarization adopt the encoder-decoder architecture that we first encountered in Chapter 1, although there are some exceptions like the GPT family of models which can also be used for summarization in few-shot settings.

Fortunately, there is a class of multilingual Transformer models, like mT5 and mBART, that come to the rescue.

    "### Metrics for text summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to most of the other tasks we’ve covered in this course, measuring the performance of text generation tasks like summarization or translation is not as straightforward. For example, given a review like “I loved reading the Hunger Games”, there are multiple valid summaries, like “I loved the Hunger Games” or “Hunger Games is a great read”. Clearly, applying some sort of exact match between the generated summary and the label is not a good solution — even humans would fare poorly under such a metric, because we all have our own writing style.\n",
    "\n",
    "For summarization, one of the most commonly used metrics is the ROUGE score (short for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). The basic idea behind this metric is to compare a generated summary against a set of reference summaries that are typically created by humans. To make this more precise, suppose we want to compare the following two summaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "    generated_summary = \"I absolutely loved reading the Hunger Games\"\n",
    "    reference_summary = \"I loved reading the Hunger Games\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "One way to compare them could be to count the number of overlapping words, which in this case would be 6. However, this is a bit crude, so instead ROUGE is based on computing the precision and recall scores for the overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For ROUGE, recall measures how much of the reference summary is captured by the generated one. If we are just comparing words, recall can be calculated according to the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Recall = Number of overlapping words / total number of words in reference summary\n",
    "\n",
    "For our simple example above, this formula gives a perfect recall of 6/6 = 1; i.e., all the words in the reference summary have been produced by the model. This may sound great, but imagine if our generated summary had been “I really really loved reading the Hunger Games all night”. This would also have perfect recall, but is arguably a worse summary since it is verbose. To deal with these scenarios we also compute the precision, which in the ROUGE context measures how much of the generated summary was relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Precision = Number of overlapping words / total number of words in generated summary\n",
    "    \n",
    "Applying this to our verbose summary gives a precision of 6/10 = 0.6, which is considerably worse than the precision of 6/7 = 0.86 obtained by our shorter one. In practice, both precision and recall are usually computed, and then the F1-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) is reported. We can do this easily in 🤗 Datasets by first installing the rouge_score package:"
