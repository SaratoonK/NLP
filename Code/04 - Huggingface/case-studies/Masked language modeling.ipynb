    "For many NLP applications involving Transformer models, you can simply take a pretrained model from the Hugging Face Hub and fine-tune it directly on your data for the task at hand. Provided that the corpus used for pretraining is not too different from the corpus used for fine-tuning, transfer learning will usually produce good results.\n",

    "However, there are a few cases where you’ll want to first fine-tune the language models on your data, before training a task-specific head. For example, if your dataset contains legal contracts or scientific articles, a vanilla Transformer model like BERT will typically treat the domain-specific words in your corpus as rare tokens, and the resulting performance may be less than satisfactory. By fine-tuning the language model on in-domain data you can boost the performance of many downstream tasks, which means you usually only have to do this step once!\n",

Like with the autocorrect feature in your phone, a good language model is one that assigns high probabilities to sentences that are grammatically correct, and low probabilities to nonsense sentences. To give you a better idea of what this looks like, you can find whole sets of “autocorrect fails” online, where the model in a person’s phone has produced some rather funny (and often inappropriate) completions!\n",

    "Assuming our test set consists mostly of sentences that are grammatically correct, then one way to measure the quality of our language model is to calculate the probabilities it assigns to the next word in all the sentences of the test set. High probabilities indicates that the model is not “surprised” or “perplexed” by the unseen examples, and suggests it has learned the basic patterns of grammar in the language. There are various mathematical definitions of perplexity, but the one we’ll use defines it as the exponential of the cross-entropy loss. Thus, we can calculate the perplexity of our pretrained model by using the Trainer.evaluate() function to compute the cross-entropy loss on the test set and then taking the exponential of the result:"
