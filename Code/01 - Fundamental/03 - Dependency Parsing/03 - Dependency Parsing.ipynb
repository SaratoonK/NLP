    "\n",
    "We will be implementing a neural dependency parser with the goal of maximizing the performance on the UAS (Unlabeled Attachment Score) metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dependency parser analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence, establishing relationships between head words, and words which modify those heads.  There are multiple types of dependency parsers, including transition-based parsers, graph-based parsers, and feature-based parsers.  We shall implement the transition-based parser, which incrementally builds up a parse one step at a time.  At every step, it maintains a partial parse, which is represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **stack** of words that are currently being processed\n",
    "- A **buffer** of words yet to be processed.\n",
    "- A **list of dependencies** predicted by the parser\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the stack only contains ROOT, the dependencies list is empty, and the buffer contains all words of the sentence in order. At each step, the parser applies a tranistion to the partial parse until its buffer is empty and the stack size is 1.  The following transitions can be applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\texttt{SHIFT}$: removes the first word from the buffer and pushes it onto the stack.\n",
    "- $\\texttt{LEFTARC}$: marks the second (second most recently aded) item on the stack as a dependent of the first item and removes the second item from the stack, adding a *first_word* $\\rightarrow$ *second_word* dependency to the dependeny list.\n",
    "- $\\texttt{RIGHTARC}$: marks the first (second msot recently aded) item on the stack as a dependent of the second item and removes the first item from the stack, adding a *second_word* $\\rightarrow$ *first_word* dependency to the dependeny list.\n",
    "\n",
    "On each step, your parser will decide among the three transitions using a neural network classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "For parsing the sentence *He has good control*, the dependency tree for the sentence is shown below.\n",

We will be using the feature set presented in *A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks (Chen and Manning 2014)*.  The function extracting these features are implemented below.  https://aclanthology.org/D14-1082.pdf\n",

    "This feature vector consists of a list of tokens (e.g., the last word in the stack, first word in the buffer, dependent of the second-to-last word in the stack if there is one, etc.). They can be represented as a list of integers $\\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2, \\cdots, w_m]$ where $m$ is the number of features and each $0 \\leq w_i \\leq |V|$ is the index of a token in the vocabulary ($|V|$ is the vocabulary size).  Then our network looks up an embedding for each word and concatenates them into a single input vector:\n",

    "$$J(\\theta) = \\text{CE}(\\mathbf{y}, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{3}y_i \\log \\hat{y}_i$$\n",
