    "## Assignment 2: Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimated Time: ~10 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick note**:  This assignment may be overwhelming for some of you.  It may be wise to set aside some significant amount of time so you can slowly go over this assignment.  The objective of this assignment is for you to understand the math behind <code>word2vec</code>, which will be a good fundamental background to understand any other NLP embedding algorithms.  We will also attempt to implement those maths into code to further enhance our understandings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s have a quick refresher on the word2vec algorithm. For full details, you may want to rewatch the zoom video we did in our first two lectures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight behind word2vec is that *a word is known by the company it keeps*. Concretely, suppose we have a **center** word $c$ and a contextual window. We shall refer to words that lie in this contextual window as **outside words** denoting $o$. For example, in Figure 1 we see that the center word $c$ is *banking*. Since the context window size is 2, the outside words are *turning*, *into*, *crises*, and *as*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the skip-gram word2vec algorithm is to accurately learn the probability distribution $P(O|C)$. Given a specific word $o$ and a specific word $c$, we want to calculate $P (O = o|C = c)$, which is the probability that word $o$ is an *outside* word for $c$, i.e., the probability that $o$ falls within the contextual window of $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"img/word2vec.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In word2vec, the conditional probability distribution is given by taking vector dot-products and applying the softmax function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P (O = o|C = c) = \\displaystyle\\frac{\\exp({u_o^{T} v_c})}{\\sum_{w \\in V} \\exp({u_w^{T} v_c})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $u_o$ is the *outside* vector representing outside word $o$, and $v_c$ is the *center* vector representing center word $c$. To contain these parameters, we have two matrices, $U$ and $V$ . The columns of $U$ are all the *outside* vectors $u_w$. The columns of $V$ are all of the *center* vectors $v_w$. Both $U$ and $V$ contain a vector for every $w \\in \\text{Vocabulary}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from lectures that, for a single pair of words $c$ and $o$, the loss is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{J}_\\text{naive-softmax}(v_c, o, U) = -\\log P(O=o |C=c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can view this loss as the cross-entropy2 between the true distribution $y$ and the predicted distribution $\\hat{y}$. Here, both $y$ and $\\hat{y}$ are vectors with length equal to the number of words in the vocabulary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the $k$th entry in these vectors indicates the conditional probability of the $k$th word being an *outside word* for the given $c$. The true empirical distribution $y$ is a one-hot vector with a 1 for the true outside word $o$, and $0$ everywhere else. The predicted distribution $\\hat{y}$ is the probability distribution $P (O|C = c)$ given by our model in above equation."

    "7. 0 to 1\n",
    "8. $\\log$ has many nice properties; (1) helps numerically because the product of a large number of small probabilities can easily underflow; this is resolved by computing instead the sum of the log probabilities; (2) cancel out nicely with $\\exp$, (3) we can use $\\log$ because it is a monotically increasing function, thus it won't affect the objective function."

For negative sampling, we have provided the function <code>getNegativeSamples</code> so please use it.  One good way to do this is first to calculate the dot product between all relevant outside word vectors within the selected indices and the center word vector like this <code>scores = (outsideVectors[indices] @ centerWordVec)[:, np.newaxis]</code>.  Then for the left side of the equation, use <code>scores[0]</code> as part of the calculation, and for the right side, use <code>-scores[1:]</code>.  The remaining should be easy, applying the already implemented <code>sigmoid</code> function, and <code>log</code> and <code>np.sum</code> accordingly.  Final reminder that the loss is of scalar (1, ) shape.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}_{\\text{neg-sample}}}{\\partial v_c} = u_o(1 - \\sigma(u_o^Tv_c)) + \\sum_{k=1}^{K} u_k(1 - \\sigma(-u_k^Tv_c))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Coding implementation*: for the left side of the equation, you may want to use <code>outsideVectors[outsideWordIdx]</code>, and for the right side of the equation, use <code>outsideVectors[negSampleWordIndices]</code>.

    "*Coding implementation*:  Both of the gradient should be simple to implement using the indexing approach we have done before.  There is some technicality, i.e., the same word may be negatively sampled multiple times. For example if an outside word is sampled twice, you shall have to double count the gradient with respect to this word. Thrice if it was sampled three times, and so forth.  A good way to do this is to first count the occurrences of indices like this:  <code>indexCount = np.bincount(indices)[:, np.newaxis]</code>, then loop through all distinct indices and multiply the gradients with the number of occurences like this: <code>for i in np.unique(indices): gradOutsideVecs[i] *= indexCount[i]</code>"
